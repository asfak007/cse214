# Linked List operations [Single way (singly)Linked List]

1. Define a "Create" function to declear a linked list with for node using dynamic memory
allocaton. Print the complete linked list after calling funvction.

2.Define an "Empty" function to chack whether the linked list is empty or not.

3.Define a "Size" function   to find the sixe of the linked list.

4.Define a "Front" function to display the first element of te linked list.

5. Define a "back" functon to display the last element of te linked list.

6.Define a "search" functon to find a "key". print "found" if the search "key"  is found in
the linked list otherwise print "Not Found ".

7.Define  a funvction to reverse the linked list. Display both list before and after reverseing.

8.Define a functon to reverse to linked list using a recursive function.Display both list before and after
reversing.

9.cpoy a linked list into a another linked list. Display both list before and anfter copy.

10.copy a linked list into anothe linked list with a recursive functon.Dispaly both lsir before and after copy.

11.Define a function to merge two linked list .Display all the list before and after merging.
